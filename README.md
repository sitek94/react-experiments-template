# ðŸ§ª React Experiments Template

Just a simple React app with file-based routing powered by React Router and Vite. I use it whenever I want to play
around or test some React library. I like this setup, because whenever I want to test something out I just create a new
file in the `examples` folder. I don't have to create new routes, import components, etc.

## Bootstrapped with Vite
